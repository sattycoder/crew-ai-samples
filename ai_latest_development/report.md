### Natural Language Processing (NLP)
#### Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans in natural language. The field has made significant progress in recent years, with notable advancements in areas such as tokenization, semantic role labeling (SRL), and intent recognition.

#### Tokenization
Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into individual words or tokens. Improved tokenization techniques have enabled better understanding and processing of natural language data, leading to improved language models.

#### Semantic Role Labeling (SRL)
SRL is a technique used to identify the roles played by entities in a sentence. Improved SRL capabilities enable better understanding and generation of natural language text.

### Machine Learning (ML)

#### Supervised Learning
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled data to predict outcomes or make decisions. Improved supervised learning techniques have enabled better understanding and processing of natural language data.

#### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning involves training models on unlabeled data to identify patterns or structure. Improved unsupervised learning techniques have enabled better understanding and generation of natural language text.

#### Deep Learning (DL)
Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on developing neural networks with multiple layers. DL has enabled more accurate and efficient processing of natural language data, enabling applications such as image recognition and speech recognition.
